Based on the available grades, I notice scores for:
- Dermatologic System I: 22
- Genitourinary System I: 21
- Psychiatry/Behavioral Medicine I: 23
- Musculoskeletal System I: 21

These scores suggest areas needing improvement, as they're relatively low. Let me create a focused study plan.

WEEK'S PRIORITY AREAS
Primary Focus:
• Dermatology
• Genitourinary System
• Psychiatry/Behavioral Medicine
• Musculoskeletal System

RECOMMENDED STUDY TECHNIQUES
1. Active Recall:
- Create flashcards for key concepts
- Self-quiz after each study session
- Teach concepts to others (even if imaginary)

2. Visual Learning:
- Draw anatomical diagrams
- Create mind maps connecting related concepts
- Use medical atlases and online resources

3. Practice Questions:
- Complete 20-30 PANCE-style questions daily
- Review both correct and incorrect answers thoroughly

RESOURCES
1. Digital:
- PANCE Prep Pearls
- UpToDate
- Medscape

2. Physical:
- Medical textbooks
- Study guides
- Personal notes

MOTIVATIONAL TIPS
• Set small, achievable daily goals
• Reward yourself after completing study blocks
• Track your progress with a study journal
• Take regular breaks (25 min study/5 min break)
• Stay connected with study groups or mentors

Remember: Your current grades don't define your potential. With consistent effort and strategic studying, you can significantly improve your understanding and performance. Focus on understanding concepts rather than memorizing facts, and always relate what you're learning to clinical scenarios.

Weekly Check-in: At the end of each week, assess:
- Which topics are clearer now?
- What areas still need work?
- How effective were your study methods?
- What adjustments are needed for next week?

Keep pushing forward - you're developing the knowledge base that will make you an excellent healthcare provider!
