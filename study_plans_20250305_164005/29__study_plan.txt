MOTIVATIONAL TIPS:
* Set small, achievable daily goals
* Track your progress with a study journal
* Reward yourself after completing daily targets
* Take regular breaks (25/5 Pomodoro technique)
* Join study groups or find a study buddy

ENCOURAGEMENT:
Your neurologic system score shows you're capable of excellent performance. Focus on applying these same successful study strategies to cardiovascular topics. Remember, consistent effort leads to improvement, and you're already showing dedication by seeking a structured study plan.

Remember to:
* Stay hydrated
* Get adequate sleep (7-8 hours)
* Take short walks between study sessions
* Maintain a healthy diet
* Reach out to instructors when needed

Adjust this plan based on your personal schedule and learning style. Good luck with your studies!
